Hey there! I've crafted a chatbot that you can unleash with just a couple of simple steps. To kick things off, fire up your command line and type 'python training.py'. This will initiate the training process, where our bot will learn the ropes and get ready to engage in some meaningful conversations.

Once the training phase is complete, all you need to do is type 'chatbot.py' and watch the magic unfold. While I must admit, it's not exactly Einstein-level intelligence, but hey, it gets the job done! Whether you're looking for a casual chat or need assistance with a specific task, this trusty little bot is here to lend a virtual hand.

So, go ahead, give it a whirl, and see what our digital friend has to offer. Who knows, you might just be pleasantly surprised by its capabilities. Happy chatting!
